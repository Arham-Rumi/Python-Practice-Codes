# Python-Practice-Codes
This repository contains codes to help practice python. I solved the problems with best possible solutions that came in mind at that time. You can also try them and let me know if you have the better way to solve the problems

In this repository, you will see a lot of codes separated by files
Each code file will contain only one problem and it's best solution according to me at that time. Some problems will have more than one solutions and I will list them all too. If you think you could do better. Just make changes and commit them in your branch in this repository

I will try to comment most of the codes too

Code files will be like

#Problem description
#Problem solution(s)
